# Introduction

Very rough code that I wrote during the Covid-19 pandemic to play Minecraft with my friends serving stay home notice.

It does not take into account people leaving and joining halfway through the gamemodes etc, because I'm too lazy to write logic for it.

Any sort of documentation is pretty much non existent apart from some comments inside the classes...

There's also no tests nor linters :3 

Made for Minecraft 1.12.2.

# Game modes includes:

- Hide and Seek
- Zombie Infection
